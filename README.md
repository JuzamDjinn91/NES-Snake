NES Snake This project is my first attempt to write a simple NES Snake game using Shiru´s NESLibrary, based on the CC65 project. You can find out more about Shiru´s NESLibrary here: http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm Also, if you are interested in the general CC65 project, you can find it here: http://www.cc65.org/ Or just visit the project directly on GitHub: https://github.com/cc65/cc65
